# Team-Agreement
Team 1 agreement - Chris Harden, Min Xie, Jared Barnes, Jordan Fleming

## Cooperation Plan

* Jordan is a strong communicator and problem solver. and wants to work on his time framing.

* Min is a great problem solver as well and hunker down and figures out issues and solutions. Gets lost in one task or feature.

* Chris is a researcher if he doesn't have the answer, he will research it and find the solution but gets lost in the weeds and optimization.

* Jared is good at processing and communication. He realizes he need needs to work on ambiguity. 

* We will have set check in times and follow up with each other on work.


## Conflict Plan

* As a team we don't feel anyone will want to hog the workload and we will be distributing tasks. If there are any issues with someone not doing their part the team will address it as a team and talk to said individual. And set up designated check in times.

* We will embrace issues and understand that we are all students and may need help. We will guide and mentor each other.

* If we feel that one partner has given up and not really trying to contribute, we will take it to the person first and if they don't care or adjust, we will take it to the instructor.

## Communication Plan

* We will keep the same hours we had in class 9am to 5pm. We will communicate breaks and a ny times we step away.

* We will communicate in slack

* Breaks will be taken as needed.

* If we have to talk after hours we will talk on Slack.

* If we start to fall behind, we will:
    1. figure out the issue and can it be changed/ Google.
    2. look for help from each other
    3. Seek help from TA/Jacob

* We will ensure all voices are heard by not muting each other, and by keeping our mindsets and actions focused on professionalism. We have set check-ins/talk times and we are all aware we each have something valuable to contribute. 

* For making sure everyone feels safe environment see our previous answer.

## Work Plan
*Trello and Github will be our project management tools. 

* We will discuss tasks and how we want to arrange them in our morning and post lunch meetings. We will grab tasks we like or feel we can do the best. 

* We will have three meetings a day for planning. Morning, post lunch and end of day. At end of day meeting, we will all review the code before pushing to 'Main'.

## Git Process
*All components of the project will live on Github.

* We all cloned the repo down to our local machines and all are listed as collaborators.
* Our git flow will be:
    
    1. personal-branch -> staging -> Main 

* For any merge into Main, all four of us will be present. Any merges from our personal branches to the Staging branch is free reign. Once in staging we are saying that the code we pushed is good and there is no issues we have found ourselves, and we have confidence with the code. Code listed in staging will be open to review by any team member at any time. Staged code can and will be reviewed and commented on before it is pushed to Main. Once we are all confident all parts work together in staging the changes can be pushed to main.
